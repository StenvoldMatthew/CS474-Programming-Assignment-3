# CS474-Programming-Assignment-3

This assignment is split into 3 seperate program files, 
question1.py
question2.py
question3.py

The first 2 programs can be run using the following in the terminal:
python3 (filename) -q (question)

So if you want to do experiemnt 1b, you can run:
python3 question1.py -q 1b

For experiment 3, you run it using the following code:
python3 question3.py -f (filename)

In this case, filename is the name of the image file you want to run it on. If left blank, it will run on lenna.png.
